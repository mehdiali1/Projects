# Personal Projects Portfolio

This repository contains some personal projects I've built to practice different programming skills and technologies. Each project demonstrates different aspects of software development.

## Projects

###  [BookManagementAPI](./BookManagementAPI/)
A Flask REST API with full CRUD operations for managing books. Features SQLite persistence, HTML forms, and JSON endpoints.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, SQLite  
**Skills:** REST API design, database operations, web development

###  [DataAnalysisNotebook](./DataAnalysisNotebook/)
Jupyter notebook demonstrating data analysis and visualization techniques using pandas and matplotlib.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Jupyter, pandas, matplotlib  
**Skills:** Data analysis, visualization, statistical analysis

###  [ExcelToDatabaseTool](./ExcelToDatabaseTool/)
A utility tool for importing Excel files into SQLite databases with error handling and data validation.

**Tech Stack:** Python, pandas, SQLAlchemy, openpyxl  
**Skills:** Data ingestion, ETL processes, file processing

###  [PersonalFinanceDashboard](./PersonalFinanceDashboard/)
A Flask web application for tracking personal expenses, categorizing transactions, and visualizing spending patterns. Built this to track my own expenses and turned out useful enough to share.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, SQLite, Chart.js, HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
**Skills:** Full-stack development, data visualization, file upload handling, responsive design

**Features:**
- CSV upload with auto-detection of bank formats
- Smart transaction categorization using keyword matching
- Interactive charts and spending trend analysis
- Transaction filtering and search functionality
- Mobile-responsive design

## Getting Started

Each project has its own README with specific setup instructions. Generally, you'll need:

```powershell
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the specific project
python app.py  # or the main script for each project
```

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL
- **Frameworks:** Flask, pandas, SQLAlchemy
- **Databases:** SQLite
- **Frontend:** Chart.js, responsive CSS, modern JavaScript
- **Tools:** Jupyter, Git, VS Code

## Skills Demonstrated

- Full-stack web development
- RESTful API design and implementation
- Database design and optimization
- Data processing and ETL workflows
- Data analysis and visualization
- User interface design and responsive development
- File handling and validation
- Security best practices

## About

These projects were built as learning exercises and portfolio pieces. They demonstrate practical programming skills and clean, maintainable code practices. Each project solves real-world problems and shows progression in different areas of software development.
