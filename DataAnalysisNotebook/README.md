# Data Analysis Notebook

## About
This Jupyter notebook is a personal project to practice data analysis and visualization using pandas and matplotlib. I use it to explore public datasets, clean messy data, and create charts for insights.

## Motivation
I wanted to get hands-on experience with real-world data and learn how to communicate findings visually. This notebook is a showcase of my skills in Python data science.

## How to Run
```powershell
pip install pandas matplotlib jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

Open `sales_analysis.ipynb` and run the cells to see the analysis.

## What's Inside
- Sample data generation (simulating real CSV data)
- Basic exploratory data analysis
- Multiple visualizations (time series, histograms, scatter plots)
- Correlation analysis and monthly aggregation
- Personal notes and insights

## Future Improvements
- Add more advanced visualizations (seaborn, plotly)
- Try machine learning models for predictions
- Work with real datasets from public sources
- Document analysis steps more thoroughly
